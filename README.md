## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- BEM
- JavaScript and the Constraint Validation API

### What I learned

I learn most of how to use form validation. Using the [SitePoint](#useful-resources) post as a source, was easy to write the validation message using Constraint Validation API, and for that needed to skip the default browser validation by adding 'novalidate' to the form tag.

```html
<form ... novalidate> ... </form>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
if (input.validity.typeMismatch) {
  // use for check correct email format
}

if (input.validity.valueMissing) {
  // use for check empty value
}
```

### Continued development

Need to practice form validation.
